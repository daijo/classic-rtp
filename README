Classic-rtp: A classic Resolution Theorem Prover

by Shaul Markovitch.

<http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~shaulm/software/classic-rtp.html>

A theorem prover written in Common Lisp. The prover implements classic resolution as described in the text books. Its main purpose is to allow students to experiment with resolution theorem proving.

Please download the following files:

* prover.lisp [written by Shaul Markovitch]. This is the main file and contains the resolution theorem prover.
* unify.lisp[Borrowed from Norvig and Russell]. The file contains the unify function and its auxilary functions.
* cnf.lisp [Borrowed from Russell and Norvig]. Contains the code to convert formula to cnf form.
* infix.lisp[borrowed from Norvig and Russell who borrowed it from Mark Kantrowitz] This file is not necessary. Its main purpose is to allow writting axioms and theorems in infix form.
* load-prover.lispLoads all the above files.
* test1.lgcA small list of axioms used for testing the system.
